The project "Sleek Space: An AR-Based Interior Decor Application" aims to
revolutionize the e-commerce furniture and decor industry by providing an immersive
and interactive shopping experience. Traditional online shopping platforms often fall
short in delivering realistic product visualization, which can lead to customer
dissatisfaction, higher return rates, and reduced engagement. To address this
challenge, the application integrates Augmented Reality (AR) to allow users to
visualize true-to-scale Three-Dimensional (3D) models of products within their
real-world environments.
The app seamlessly combines AR with e-commerce functionalities, enabling users to
explore products, examine them in detail using a 360-degree viewer, and proceed to a
smooth and secure checkout process powered by Stripe Payment Gateway. Firebase
Authentication ensures secure user login and registration, while Firebase Firestore
serves as the backend for managing product data, user details, and order history.
Developed for cross-platform compatibility on both iOS and Android, the application
leverages React.js for its frontend interface, ensuring a responsive and engaging user
experience. The AR capabilities are further enhanced using Model Viewer for
rendering photorealistic 3D models. This innovative solution empowers users to make
informed purchase decisions, reduces product returns, and enhances customer
engagement by bridging the gap between online shopping and real-world
visualization.
The project is currently in an advanced stage, featuring functional AR visualization,
product exploration, and secure e-commerce integration, setting a new benchmark for
immersive online shopping experiences.
